# piratebox-rpi4
PirateBox Project for Raspberry Pi 4

Notes:
- I don't have much time to devote to this as I would like. Please be aware this is in now way a functional project at this point, just testing different apporaches.
- The goal of this project is to have a script that can be run on a vanilla Raspbian install to get it working as a piratebox. 

Any help would be welcomed.
